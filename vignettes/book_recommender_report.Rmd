## Introduction

This report summarizes the progress on the ***Book Recommendation*** project. The system recommends books to users based on their ratings using collaborative filtering.

## Data Description

The app uses two main datasets from the Book-Crossing dataset:

***BX-Books.csv***: contains book metadata (ISBN, title, author).

***BX-Book-Ratings.csv***: contains user ratings for the books.

Data cleaning steps include removing zero ratings, filtering users with fewer than 10 ratings, and filtering books with fewer than 20 ratings to improve recommendation quality.

## Methodology

Constructed a user-item rating matrix.

Normalized ratings to reduce user bias.

Trained a User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF) model using the recommenderlab package.

Incorporated dynamic user ratings collected via the Shiny UI.

## Application Overview

The Shiny app features:

***A search bar to filter books by title or author.***
```{r image-plot1, echo = FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("search.png")
```

***Display of 12 books with cover images and star rating inputs.***
```{r image-plot2, echo = FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("books.png")
```

***A button to generate recommendations once at least 5 books are rated.***
```{r image-plot3, echo = FALSE, out.width='25%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("recommendation.png")
```

***A display of the recommended books.***
